# Source code accompanying the paper _Conditional particle filters with bridge backward sampling_

This repository is in construction.

### Remark about naming of some files

For "historical reasons", in some file and function names "bbcpf" ("block backward conditional particle filter", earlier working name of developed CPF) is sometimes used instead of "cpfbbs",
which is the name used in the paper.
Similarly, sometimes the CP-RBM model of the experiments section is referenced with "lgcpr" (short for "log-Gaussian Cox process, reflected").

## Conditional killing resampling and conditional systematic resampling with mean partition

The source code for these algorithms may be found from the external package [Resamplings.jl](https://github.com/skarppinen/Resamplings.jl).
